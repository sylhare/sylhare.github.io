## Introduction

I have created a package for prime algorithms called [nprime](https://github.com/sylhare/nprime). 

Algorithm developed : 

- Eratosthenes sieve based
- Fermat's test (based on Fermat's theorem)
- Prime generating functions
- Miller Rabin predictive algorithm

To install the package use pip:

    pip install nprime

## Math

Here are a bit of information to help understand some of the algorithms.

### Congruence

 "`≡`" means congruent, `a ≡ b (mod m)` implies that 
`m / (a-b), ∃ k ∈ Z` that verifies `a = kn + b`
   
 which implies:

    a ≡ 0 (mod n) <-> a = kn <-> "a" is divisible by "n" 
    
### Strong Pseudoprime

A strong [pseudoprime](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html) to a base `a` is an odd composite number `n` 
with `n-1 = d·2^s` (for d odd) for which either `a^d = 1(mod n)` or `a^(d·2^r) = -1(mod n)` for some `r = 0, 1, ..., s-1` </br>
    
### Erathostene's Sieve

#### How to use

Implementation of the sieve of erathostenes that discover the primes and their composite up to a limit.
It returns a dictionary:
  - the key are the primes up to n
  - the value is the list of composites of these primes up to n

```python
from nprime.pyprime import sieve_eratosthenes

# With as a parameter the upper limit
sieve_eratosthenes(10)
>> {2: [4, 6, 8], 3: [6, 9], 5: [], 7: []}
```

#### Theory

This sieve mark as composite the multiple of each primes. It is an efficient way to find primes.
For `n ∈ N` with `n > 2` and for `∀ a ∈[2, ..., √n]` then `n/a ∉ N` is true.

### Fermat's Theorem

#### How to use

A Probabilistic algorithm taking `t` randoms numbers `a` and testing the Fermat's theorem on number `n > 1`
Prime probability is right is `1 - 1/(2^t)`
Returns a boolean: True if `n` passes the tests.

```python
from nprime.pyprime import fermat

# With n the number you want to test
fermat(n)
```

#### Theory

If `n` is prime then `∀ a ∈[1, ..., n-1]`

```
    a^(n-1) ≡ 1 (mod n) ⇔ a^(n-1) = kn + 1
```
   
### Miller rabin

#### How to use

A probabilistic algorithm which determines whether a given number (n > 1) is prime or not.
The miller_rabin tests is repeated `t` times to get more accurate results.
Returns a boolean: True if `n` passes the tests.

```python
from nprime.pyprime import miller_rabin

# With n the number you want to test
miller_rabin(n)
```

#### Theory
For `n ∈ N` and `n > 2`, </br>
Take a random `a ∈ {1,...,n−1}` </br>
Find `d` and `s` such as with `n - 1 = 2^s * d` (with d odd) </br>
if `(a^d)^2^r ≡ 1 mod n` for all `r` in `0` to `s-1` </br>
Then `n` is prime.

The test output is false of 1/4 of the "a values" possible in `n`, 
so the test is repeated t times.
