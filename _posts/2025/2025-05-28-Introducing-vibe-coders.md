Vibe coding use to be a day in the life of a developer where one could implement a feature without leaving the IDE
searching for answers on the web or stackoverflow.

With AI agents and IDE like [cursor][1] or [windsurf][2], anybody can do that!
Which means, your project repository might be targeted as potential avenue for all those new AI empowered users to dump
their freshly generated code.

We'll call them _vibe coders_, and while some contributions might be welcome to increase velocity it could quickly eat up
all the gain it might provide due to sheer amount of review it would be necessary to make sure we're not just _yolo-ing_
our way to prod.

Given that I recently worked in such a predicament,
onboarding non-technical people into our development team as vibe coders. 
I wanted to share some of the guidelines we've put in place. 

## Guidelines for Vibe Coders

### AI Generated Code

AI can do with no effort 80% of the job, but the 20% remaining will take you a non-null amount to finish,
exponentially proportional to the amount of code that 80% represents...

> That's the pareto rule of vibe coding, if the review process is too long because there are many things to change, 
> adjust, then it's probably not worth it, as your developer will spend more time explaining than it would take to fix.

You could want that retro-action to level up the skills of the vibe coders, 
but for occasional users that are often non-technical then that's not worth it.

In those case I would recommend users to make contribution up to their level of general understanding.
This means that vibe coders should not be expected to write complex code, or touch the business logic of the application.
They should rather focus on UI/UX, marketing, or documentation changes (fixing, typo, fonts, colors, display, etc.).

### Development contribution process

To receive the contribution from vibe coders, you will want a process that allows to gate-keep contributions so that
they do not directly impact the main branch of your codebase. 
I would not recommend using [trunk-based development][10] for vibe coders, and would instead advise to use a pull request.

The other advantages of using PR, is that it's much easier for vibe coders to find out why a contribution would be rejected.
This can be done via your CI/CD which can include:
- Automated linting and formatting checks to ensure style consistency
- Static analysis to catch common issues and enforce coding standards
- Automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) to make sure the contribution does not break anything
- Automated Security checks for vulnerabilities
- AI Code review tools (Feed the AI generated code to an AI reviewer, the circle of AI ðŸ¤–) to help with the review process

A well build CI/CD helps the whole team contributing to the project, not just vibe coders!

### Guidelines

Once the process is set and clear for everyone, you can have some more rules,
and guidelines that the vibe coders should follow.
You will want to use the `README.md` or [`Contributing.md`][4] file to store guidelines and process for both the developers 
and AI agents. 
You will also want to document how to lint, test, build, run the project locally within the repository.

For the guidelines to your vibe coders, you can include the following points:
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on simple changes that do not require deep understanding of the codebase.
  - No complex logic, no backend changes, most likely no new dependencies
- **Contribute to what you know**: Focus on changes that are related to the user interface, user experience, marketing, 
  or documentation that you know and can validate.
- **Try locally**: The setup should be documented so you can try the changes locally, 
  so you can feed the errors straight back to the agent rather than copy/pasting them from the CI/CD.
- **Refer to the AI rules**: Use a set of AI rules that could point the AI agent to or that it will pick up by default (like cursor or windsurf).
  - This is sometime saved as `ai_rules.md` or as custom rules set like in [cursor][5] and are usually an obvious set of rules on how to generate code, what to focus on, and what not to do.

Friction may occur, so we should all be open and try to make the process as smooth as possible.
As much as developers should review vibe coded PRs, the vibe coders should also be part of the review process!
This way the user experience feedbacks happen before the code is merged, 
and tiny changes can be agreed on and delegated to the vibe coder to fix.

### AI rules example

Here is an example of a set of rules that could be used by the AI agent to generate code for a frontend project.
WHat's great is that you can always ask the AI to follow those rules (by "referring" to it), and it will try to do so.

```markdown
# AI Coding Assistant Rules

## Project Overview
- This is a JavaScript/TypeScript frontend project
- We use React with Chakra for UI components
- Follow modern ES6+ syntax
- Use TypeScript types whenever possible

## Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks, not class components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use a standard structure: imports â†’ types â†’ component â†’ exports
- Add proper JSDoc comments for component props
- Avoid inline styles, use CSS modules or styled components
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Provide alt text for all images

## Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Maintain at least 80% test coverage

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained libraries with TypeScript support

## Prohibited Practices
- No console.log in production code
- No any types in TypeScript
- No direct DOM manipulation
- No commented-out code
- No comments  
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
```

This is an example, but as the agent becomes more intelligent, 
it will be able to pick up those details with more ease.

We also use it, to specify specific company component library that we'd like to use, or specific design system.
This file can get updated based on what the tool returned to help it generate code with better confidence.

If you are looking into how the agent can be set up, 
you can check out the [CL4R1T4S project][6] which drops the full system prompts and guidelines 
from AI models or agents of famous provides.

## Conclusion

Setting up guidelines is as much as to help us guarantee quality in our codebase, reduce friction with the developers,
and make sure everything is set up to get the most meaningful vibe coded contributions.
Well onboarded vibe contributors could boost your team's velocity,
and give that touch of polish that makes a product truly great!
